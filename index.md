# Why this study?

The last few years, we have seen the rising of lots of movement fighting for **civil rights**, whether it is **anti-racist**, **feminist** or in our case, for **gay rights**. Indeed, it seems that with the **liberation of speech** thanks to **social networks**, every one can have a voice and not only journalists, politicians or personnalities on TV shows, as it used to be the case. Therefore, **minorities are getting finaly heard.** 

This has lead to very positive outcome, with a general mind opening on the matter of gay rights. On **june 26, 2015, the U.S Supreme court legalized same-sex marriage in the fifty states.**

In our data story, we are going to focus on the evolution of opinions regarding **LGBT community** in each states of the United States, with a special attention to politiciansâ€™s statements.   


# Who talks about it ?
As it is a societal topic, lots of different persons talk about it. Let's see what **politicians** say about it. First, let see the distribution of senators in each state.


2015                                              | 2019

As we can see **California, Vermont, Florida and Texas** are the major states who talk about it. For **California** it is not surprising as it is considered as a very **liberal state** in regard to **LGBT rights**. Discrimination protections regarding sexual orientation and gender identity were adopted in **2003**. It is also the first state in the U.S. to **legalize domestic partnerships between same-sex couples in 1999**. Same-sex adoption has also been legal statewide since 2003, permitting stepchild adoption and joint adoption between same-sex couples. 

Same for **New York**, which is seen as a very **socially liberal** state. Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since **1980**. Same-sex marriage has been legal statewide since 2011. In addition, both conversion therapy on minors and the gay and trans panic defense have been banned since 2019. Also, New York City is now seen as **one of the most LGBT-friendly cities in the U.S.**

For **Florida**, it is not a a very progressive state as same-sex sexual activity became legal after Supreme Court's decision on June 26, 2003. Nevertheless, there are laws to protect against LGBT discrimination. 

In opposition, **Texas** has always been a very **conservative state** and LGBT people face legal and social challenges and discriminations. There is no statewide law banning anti-LGBT discrimination. Neverthelees, same-sex marriage is legal since 2015 as it became mandatory in the U.S.

Now let's see the repartition of **democrats/republicans** speakers:

**Democrats**, who tend to support LGBT rights, talk more on the subject than **republicans.** 

But politicians are not the major part of the debat. Indeed, lots of other personnailities talk on gay right. Let's look at their different occupations:

As we can see **actors** play a very important role, the politicians are quite far behind! One could find surprising that **politicians represent 9.1%** while **actors represent 23.3%**. Politicians are the ones who can apply laws and create change, in both directions, depending on the opinion. But at the same time, actors have lots of **influence** and are often quoted in the media in case of a **coming out** or an opinion + they often play the role of a LGBTQIA+ person. 

Finally, when analyzing the coverage of a minority's rights, it is interesting to look at the **gender of the speakers** as in the U.S, **white males are often over-represented** and tend to have more spaces and time to express their opinions whereas others minority, even the concerned one are less heard. Let's see if it the case here:

2015                                                | 2019
:--------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:

![Alt text](other_gender_2015.png?raw=true "Title") |![Alt text](other_gender_2019.png?raw=true "Title")



As expected, **males represent almost 75% of the speakers**. We can see a small increase of women speakers between 2015 and 2019. The distribution without male and women represented allows us to visualize minorities that otherwise are completely crushed by men and women. On this new scale, transgender female are very present as well as non-binary person. 
Therefore, it is interesting to note that a **majority of the quotes** are from **male speakers**. It really shows that LGBTQIA+ people are still not as represented as they should, even on the topics of their own rights.

And last but not least, **religion is often evoked** when talking about LGBTGIA+ rights and acceptance. We wanted to have a look at the distribution of religion related to quotes. 
![Alt text](religion.png?raw=true "Title")

**Catholics** represent **13%** of the U.S population, **baptists 15%**, **atheists about 4%** and **jewish 2%** whereas **muslims are 1.1%**. Therefore the distribution is quite logical and follows the order of porportion, except for baptists who tend to talk less about it then other religions.
