# Why this study?

The last few years, we have seen the rising of lots of movement fighting for **civil rights**, whether it is **anti-racist**, **feminist** or in our case, for **gay rights**. Indeed, it seems that with the **liberation of speech** thanks to **social networks**, every one can have a voice and not only journalists, politicians or personnalities on TV shows, as it used to be the case. Therefore, **minorities are getting finaly heard,** but are they really getting more accepted?

This has lead to very positive outcome, with a general mind opening on the matter of gay rights. On **june 26, 2015, the U.S Supreme court legalized same-sex marriage in the fifty states,** what impact did it have on the american opinions?

In our data story, we are going to focus on the evolution of opinions regarding **LGBT+ community** in each states of the United States, with a special attention to politiciansâ€™s statements.   


# Who talks about it ?
As it is a societal topic, lots of different persons talk about it. Let's see what **politicians** say about it. First, let see the distribution of senators in each state.


2015                                              | 2019
:------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:

As we can see **California, Vermont, Florida and Texas** are the major states who talk about it. For **California** it is not surprising as it is considered as a very **liberal state** in regard to **LGBT+ rights**. Discrimination protections regarding sexual orientation and gender identity were adopted in **2003**. It is also the first state in the U.S. to **legalize domestic partnerships between same-sex couples in 1999**. Same-sex adoption has also been legal statewide since 2003, permitting stepchild adoption and joint adoption between same-sex couples. 

Same for **New York**, which is seen as a very **socially liberal** state. Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since **1980**. Same-sex marriage has been legal statewide since 2011. In addition, both conversion therapy on minors and the gay and trans panic defense have been banned since 2019. Also, New York City is now seen as **one of the most LGBT-friendly cities in the U.S.**

For **Florida**, it is not a a very progressive state as same-sex sexual activity became legal after Supreme Court's decision on June 26, 2003. Nevertheless, there are laws to protect against LGBT discrimination. 

In opposition, **Texas** has always been a very **conservative state** and LGBT people face legal and social challenges and discriminations. There is no statewide law banning anti-LGBT discrimination. Neverthelees, same-sex marriage is legal since 2015 as it became mandatory in the U.S. We will see how the political party impact the number of quotations for a state and what ideas are related in the statements.

First, let's see the repartition of **democrats/republicans** speakers:

![Alt text](proportion_d_r.png?raw=true "Title")

**Democrats**, who tend to support LGBT rights, talk more on the subject than **republicans.** 

But politicians are not the major part of the debat. Indeed, lots of other personnailities talk on gay right. Let's look at their different occupations:

![Alt text](occupations.png?raw=true "Title")

As we can see **actors** play a very important role, the politicians are quite far behind! One could find surprising that **politicians represent 9.1%** while **actors represent 23.3%**. Politicians are the ones who can apply laws and create change, in both directions, depending on the opinion. But at the same time, actors have lots of **influence** and are often quoted in the media in case of a **coming out** or an opinion + they often play the role of a LGBTQIA+ person. 

Finally, when analyzing the coverage of a minority's rights, it is interesting to look at the **gender of the speakers** as in the U.S, **white males are often over-represented** and tend to have more spaces and time to express their opinions whereas others minority, even the concerned one are less heard. Let's see if it the case here:

![Alt text](gender_all_log.png?raw=true "Title")

2015                                                | 2019
:--------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:
![Alt text](gender_2015.png?raw=true "Title")       |  ![Alt text](gender_2019.png?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](other_gender_2015.png?raw=true "Title") |![Alt text](other_gender_2019.png?raw=true "Title")



As expected, **males represent almost 75% of the speakers**. We can see a small increase of women speakers between 2015 and 2019. The distribution without male and women represented allows us to visualize minorities that otherwise are completely crushed by men and women. On this new scale, transgender female are very present as well as non-binary person. 
Therefore, it is interesting to note that a **majority of the quotes** are from **male speakers**. It really shows that LGBTQIA+ people are still not as represented as they should, even on the topics of their own rights.

And last but not least, **religion is often evoked** when talking about LGBTGIA+ rights and acceptance. We wanted to have a look at the distribution of religion related to quotes. 
![Alt text](religion.png?raw=true "Title")

**Catholics** represent **13%** of the U.S population, **baptists 15%**, **atheists about 4%** and **jewish 2%** whereas **muslims are 1.1%**. Therefore the distribution is quite logical and follows the order of porportion, except for baptists who tend to talk less about it then other religions.


# What are they saying ?

![Alt text](topic_2015_2.png?raw=true "Title")

The topic modelling from 2015 reveals that **marriage** is a topic that was very frequent. It was associated with **right, discrimination, equality.** Indeed, the **gay marriage was legalized in the 50 states on June 26, 2015 ruled by the Supreme Court.** The matter has been the focus of speculation for month. **Barack Obama**, president at the time,  praised the Supreme Court's ruling. Before this decision, it has been a very stormy debate with multiple states that banned it but also several states that legalized it and then re-banned it few years later. Even Barack Obama did not have a very clear position on it and had several declaration in both directions. What really made the difference was not solely the work of the lawyers and plaintiffs who brought the case but really the **decades of activism** that made the idea of gay marriage seem right. This demonstrates **the impact Americans had on the evolution of the law**. It is therefore very interesting to look at statements from all Americans. We performed a sentimental analysis of their statements and compared it with politicians. 

![Alt text](mean_score_pol_people.png?raw=true "Title")

It shows that the **Americans tend to have slightly increased the positive sentiment** of their quotations from 2015 to 2020 and in the same pattern, slighlty **decreased the negative sentiment** with nevertheless a peak in 2016 (might have a link with Trump's election). For **politicians,** the tendency is quite opposite, with **minor decrease in positivity** and **minor increase in negative sentiment**. 

Let's see how did the topics evolved in 2019.

![Alt text](topic_2019.png?raw=true "Title")

In 2019, a topic sorts out which contains the words **child, parent, and sexuality**. It is a really interesting bag of words as it points out various subject that emerged through the year. After the legalization of marriage, a key subject was **child adoption.** Until 2017, laws related to LGBT+ couples adopting children varied by state. Some states granted full adoption rights to same-sex couples, while others banned same-sex adoption or only allowed one partner in a same-sex relationship to adopt the biological child of the other. But, **on June 26, 2017, the U.S Supreme Court made adoption by same-sex couples legal in all 50 states.** Attitudes toward same-sex parenting have improved as the number of same-sex couples and same-sex parenting overall has increased in the U.S.

There have also been lots of debate with the increasing number of **film or TV shows involving LGBTQIA+ people** in it. If it is seen as a major progress to acceptance and more representations, some conservative movement claim that it is not appropriate for children especially. In 2019, major LGBTQIA+ movies came out, such as BPM (beats per minutes) or Call me by your name. 


# ACCEPTANCE

As we have seen so far, U.S have voted some important laws toward equality for LGBTQIA+, with the gay marriage and child adoption. Nevertheless, the community still faces lots and various form of discriminations and violence all over the states. We wanted to have a look and compare each state to see where it is the most accepted and equally-treated and where it is the worst.

First, let's see how the distribution of hate crimes due to sexual orientation in all the states has evolved in 2015 and 2019.

Most of the states have very small values with less then 100 cases. But some states stand out with high peaks. In California, for example, it went from around 550 to almost 700 cases. Same for Washington, with around 200 in 2015 and almost 300 in 2019. In Texas as well, with an augmentation of almost 100 cases.
Overall, the number of assaults has increased from 2015 to 2019. 

Moreover, we collected our data from the FBI website but it is likely dramatically underestimated as point out experts, because of given flaws in the current data collection process and massive discrepancies with the much larger number of self-reported incidents.

Finally, we collected data on LGBTQIA+ population over the states to see where it is the most important.
