# Why this study?

The last few years, we have seen the rising of lots of movement fighting for **civil rights**, whether it is **anti-racist**, **feminist** or in our case, for **gay rights**. Indeed, it seems that with the **liberation of speech** thanks to **social networks**, every one can have a voice and not only journalists, politicians or personnalities on TV shows, as it used to be the case. Therefore, **minorities are getting finaly heard.** 

This has lead to very positive outcome, with a general mind opening on the matter of gay rights. On **june 26, 2015, the U.S Supreme court legalized same-sex marriage in the fifty states.**

In our data story, we are going to focus on the evolution of opinions regarding **LGBT community** in each states of the United States, with a special attention to politiciansâ€™s statements.   


# Who talks about it ?
As it is a societal topic, lots of different persons talk about it. Let's see what **politicians** say about it. First, let see the distribution of senators in each state.

As we can see **California, Vermont, Florida and Texas** are the major states who talk about it. For California it is not surprising as it is considered as a very liberal state in regard to LGBT rights. Discrimination protections regarding sexual orientation and gender identity were adopted in 2003. It is also the first state in the U.S. to legalize domestic partnerships between same-sex couples in 1999. Same-sex adoption has also been legal statewide since 2003, permitting stepchild adoption and joint adoption between same-sex couples. 

Same for Vermont, which is seen as the most LGBT-friendly state. It was the first state to legally recognize same-sex unions, when it established civil unions for same-sex couples in 2000. Same-sex marriage was then legalized in 2009, way before national legalization in  2015. 

For Florida, it is not a a very progressive state as same-sex sexual activity became legal after Supreme Court's decision on June 26, 2003. Nevertheless, there are laws to protect against LGBT discrimination. 

In opposition, Texas has always been a very conservative state and LGBT people face legal and social challenges and discriminations. There is no statewide law banning anti-LGBT discrimination.

Now let's see the repartition of **democrats/republicans** speakers:

Democrats, who tend to support LGBT rights, talk more on the subject than republicans. 

But politicians are not the major part of the debat. Indeed, lots of other personnailities talk on gay right. Let's look at their different occupations:

As we can see actors play a very important role, quite far behind are the politicians! One could find surprising that politicians represent 9.1% while actors represent 23.3%. Politicians are the ones who can apply laws and create change, in both directions, depending on the opinion. But at the same time, actors have lots of influence and are often quoted in the media in case of a coming out or an opinion + they often play the role of a lgbtqia+ person.
